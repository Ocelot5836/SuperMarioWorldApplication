If you wish to modify the assets for the game, this will tell you how.

OSMW FORMAT:
    Each command is separated by ';'
    Each parameter for each command is separated by '_'
    There are NO spaces in between anything as that will mess with the reading
    
    ex: commandHere:parameter0_parameter1_parameter2_parameter3;action1;action2;action3;action4;action5
    
TEXTURES:
    Textures are loaded as images so they have the capability to be ANY size you wish
    Textures can be modified by changing the pixel data at that texture in it's map
    
    ex: To modify grass, go to tiles.png and change the grass texture in there
