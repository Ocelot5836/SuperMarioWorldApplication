text=Super Mario World is pretty much a game that was origionally created for the SNES. I decided to port it to the device mod once I learned it was possible to clip rendering onto a screen. The engine is custom made and will have a tutorial on how to make a similar engine. Those videos should hopefully come out soon.

text=My name is &eBrandon Silva&r, also known as &eOcelot5836&r, and I have been programming for roughly four years now. I would consider myself an intermediate coder at &cJava&r since I know and understand the basics of the language. There are many above me who could probably think twenty different ways to do what I have done here, but that doesn't mean I can't do what I want to accomplish. I always try to keep on learning from people who are better at programming (like &4MrCrayfish&r) than I since that allows me to learn and grow as not only a programmer, but a person. I hope any person who has such a dream as to program can take the chance to become the very best programmer the world has ever seen!
